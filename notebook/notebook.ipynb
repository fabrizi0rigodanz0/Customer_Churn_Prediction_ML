    "In the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce, understanding customer behavior has become a cornerstone of strategic marketing. An emerging e-commerce giant, \"FarTrend,\" has experienced rapid growth by offering a wide range of products from fashion to electronics, catering to over 3400 customers across diverse demographics. Despite their success, FarTrend faces challenges in personalizing marketing efforts and predicting future purchasing behavior, crucial for sustaining growth and enhancing customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "FarTrend's extensive customer database reveals purchasing patterns over the past year but lacks actionable insights to anticipate the needs of new customers. Traditional marketing strategies have yielded moderate success; however, the leadership team believes that a more data-driven approach could unlock exponential growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working on the marketing intelligence team! Your goal is to develop a  machine learning model that segments FarTrend's customer base and predicts future purchases of new customers within their first year. This model aims to transform FarTrend approach to customer engagement by delivering personalized marketing campaigns and tailored product recommendations."
